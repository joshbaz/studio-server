### Query Parameters

- `status`: Filter by job status (waiting, active, completed, failed, cancelled)
- `type`: Filter by resource type (film, episode)

### Clear Job Options

- `status: "completed"` - Clear only completed jobs
- `status: "failed"` - Clear only failed jobs  
- `status: "cancelled"` - Clear only cancelled jobs
- `status: "all"` - Clear all finished jobs

## Frontend Integration

### Job Type Toggle
The Video Jobs Manager now includes a toggle between:
- **Transcoding Jobs**: Traditional video processing
- **Upload Jobs**: DigitalOcean Spaces upload operations

### Statistics Dashboard
Real-time statistics for both job types:
- Total jobs count
- Waiting jobs
- Active jobs
- Completed jobs
- Failed jobs
- Cancelled jobs

### Progress Visualization
- **Transcoding Jobs**: Detailed progress for splitting, transcoding, merging, and uploading
- **Upload Jobs**: Upload progress with content type details

### Action Buttons
- **View Progress**: Expand detailed progress information
- **Retry**: Retry failed upload jobs
- **Cancel**: Stop active upload jobs
- **Clean Up**: Remove temporary files for failed jobs
- **Sync**: Synchronize job status with queue
- **Delete**: Remove completed/failed job records

## Queue Integration

### BullMQ Queues
- **`upload-hls-to-s3`**: HLS files and subtitle uploads
- **`upload-master-playlist`**: Master playlist uploads

### Job Creation
Upload jobs are automatically created when:
1. HLS files are queued for upload
2. Master playlists are queued for upload
3. Subtitle files are queued for upload

### Progress Updates
Real-time progress updates via WebSocket events:
- `uploadProgress`: Upload progress updates
- `JobCompleted`: Job completion notifications
- `JobFailed`: Job failure notifications
- `JobCancelled`: Job cancellation notifications

## Error Handling

### Automatic Retry
- Failed upload jobs can be retried with a single click
- Retry creates new queue jobs with fresh client IDs
- Maintains all original job metadata and file paths

### Cleanup Operations
- **Failed Jobs**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- **Stuck Jobs**: Detection and status synchronization
- **Cancelled Jobs**: Proper cleanup and state management

### Status Synchronization
- Database status automatically syncs with queue state
- Handles edge cases like stuck or orphaned jobs
- Provides accurate job status information

## Usage Examples

### Retry Failed Upload
```javascript
// Retry a failed HLS upload job
const response = await apiRequest.post(`/v1/studio/upload-jobs/${jobId}/retry`);
```

### Clear Completed Jobs
```javascript
// Clear all completed upload jobs
const response = await apiRequest.post('/v1/studio/upload-jobs/clear', { 
  status: 'completed' 
});
```

### Fix Stuck Jobs
```javascript
// Automatically fix stuck upload jobs
const response = await apiRequest.post('/v1/studio/upload-jobs/fix-stuck');
```

### Performance Metrics
- Upload job completion rates
- Average upload duration
- Failure rate tracking
- Queue backlog monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Upload Jobs Not Appearing**
   - Check queue worker status
   - Verify database connection
   - Check job creation logs

2. **Progress Updates Not Working**
   - Verify WebSocket connection
   - Check client ID matching
   - Verify progress event emission

3. **Retry Not Working**
   - Check job status (must be 'failed')
   - Verify queue worker availability
   - Check job metadata completeness

### Debug Information
The system includes comprehensive logging:
- Job creation and status updates
- Queue operation details
- Error messages and stack traces
- Progress update events

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Bulk Operations**: Retry multiple failed jobs at once
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by upload type, content type, date range
- **Performance Analytics**: Upload speed and efficiency metrics
- **Automated Cleanup**: Scheduled cleanup of old job records
- **Email Notifications**: Job failure and completion alerts
